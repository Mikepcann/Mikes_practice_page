        <p>On this page I will show how you can add images to you HTML pages. The important feature here is the "img" tag that can be used to 
        add images. This tag does not need a closing tag. It is followed by the "src" attribute which will link to an image saved in the "image" folder.
        The default when adding in multiple pictures to a page is to display them horizontally across the page. You could add in 
        a "br" to break up the images and show them vertically.</p>
        <p>Using the "atl" attribute within an "img" tag can add readable text if the image does not load to the page. Good feature for 
        screen reader functions.
        </p>
 
        <h4>Images</h4>
        <img src="images/frog-graduated.png" alt="Green frog granulated png">
        <img src="images/frog-square.jpg" alt="Green frog square jpg">
        <img src="images/frog.gif" alt="Green frog gif" >
        <img src="images/frog.jpg" alt="Green frog jpg" >
        <img src="images/frog.png" alt="Green frog png" >

        <h4>Hyperlinks</h4>
        <p>Throughout this website I have used the "a href="index.html" as an example to 
            jump between the pages (as seen on the bottom of the page) with hyper links. You can wrap a Hyperlink around text, 
        and that would look like <a href="http://www.google.com">this</a>.<br>If you just link directly to a website by enterting the 
        address after the "href" it will take you to that page in the same broswer tab, but if you link it like 
        <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">this</a>, it will open it in a new page. We can tell the browser to open a new page by adding a "target=_blank" to the 
        "href" after the website or image address. </p>

        <p>This is just some extra text to test things out.</p>
